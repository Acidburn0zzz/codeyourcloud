**Created by [Michael Kaminsky](https://mkaminsky11.github.io)**

The goal of this project is to allow people around the globe to collaborate on coding projects via Google Drive and OneDrive. It's that simple.

### Installation Notes
This is only the **FRONTEND**. There is also a backend component which is not open-source (yet), which is used for some things like preferences and authentication. The goal of publishing this is to show others how to successfully interact with the Google Drive and OneDrive APIs.

### The Good Parts
If you want to see the places where all of the _magic_ happens, take a look at `js/drive.js`, `js/sky.js`, and `js/tabs.js`. Enjoy!
