<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>To allow people around the globe to collaborate on coding projects via Google Drive. It's that simple. So far, I have yet to see a website or program that accomplishes these tasks for all major programming languages. This is an attempt to change that, and it seems to be working well so far.</p>
