Installed your app in google business apps, associates fine with filetyles (xml, php etc)... however every time I try to open a file to edit, I get sent to this stupid about page. I log in with google to your about page, go back to google drive, looks like its loading the document and then redirects back to about.
Unfortunate, I was really excited to try this.

Hello,
I've been having issues opening files when I have both my personal and corporate google accounts logged in. It seems it is unable to differentiate which account it is supposed to use with the file. A work around for now is that I've shared the file with both accounts, and it seems to randomly choose which account is in use, but it works.

Thanks for providing such an awesome tool! It is very well polished and I am very impressed. It has made group projects at school way easier to accomplish!
