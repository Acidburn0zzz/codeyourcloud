I think you could check the terminal too, not only use the interpreter (with python, for example) as to run the code. Add a way to "save as..." a file (because, when I create a document I can't save it, or I doesn't find a button to it). Fix some bugs, many times when I open a file, it just doesn't open, it remains on the loading page for hours. You have to create an app for iOS, I doesn't know if it have one for Android, but surely must have for all devices. Besides, not only an app for Chrome as for Firefox too, Opera and other browsers. Code Your Cloud is a great app, I've tryed to use Codeanywhere, Koding, and those other websites, but I'm still in Code Your Cloud (because It's better, but still have to evolve).
